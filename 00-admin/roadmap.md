- Manage servers and devices across both on-prem and cloud
- Document a full hybrid architecture and troubleshooting playbook
- Build a **capstone project** demonstrating hybrid infrastructure skills

**Target Milestones:**

- Be comfortable in hybrid identity & device management conversations
- Ready to start pursuing **AZ-800/801 (Windows Server Hybrid)** after this track
