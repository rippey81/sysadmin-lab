# 🛠️ Hybrid SysAdmin & Cloud Engineer Home Lab — 60-Day Training Bootcamp

Welcome to my 60-day hybrid systems engineering lab, documenting my hands-on journey from Systems Support Analyst → SysAdmin → Hybrid Infrastructure Engineer → Azure Cloud Administrator.

This project is a day-by-day, lab-focused portfolio, covering:

Linux & Windows Server

Networking & Infrastructure

Scripting & Automation (Bash + PowerShell)

Azure Administration (AZ-104)

Hybrid Identity (AD DS ↔ Entra ID)

Intune & Device Management

Azure Arc, File Sync, Backup, and DR

Everything in this repo is built from real labs, real configurations, real errors, and real troubleshooting — not theory.

## 📅 Daily Learning Method

Every lab day includes:

✅ Hands-on lab tasks

🧠 Concept deep dives

💻 Commands, scripts, and configs

📝 Notes + troubleshooting

📂 Screenshots, diagrams, and deliverables

This is designed as a living, evolving technical portfolio for leveling up in IT and Cloud.
