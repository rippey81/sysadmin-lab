# ⚙️ Day 5 – Shell Scripting (Linux) & PowerShell (Windows)

**Date:** July 11, 2025  
**Focus Area:** Automating sysadmin tasks with Bash and PowerShell

---

## 🐧 Bash Scripting (Linux)

- Created `.sh` files with shebang line `#!/bin/bash`
- Wrote basic conditionals using `if`, `elif`, and `else`
- Used `read` for user input and `id` to validate users
- Created an interactive script to check if a Linux user exists

```bash
#!/bin/bash
echo "Enter a username to check:"
read user

if id "$user" &>/dev/null; then
  echo "✅ User '$user' exists."
else
  echo "❌ User '$user' does not exist."
fi


🪟 PowerShell Scripting (Windows)
Learned how .ps1 files are used for automation

Wrote a PowerShell script to check for a Windows service

Learned that PowerShell returns objects, not just strings

powershell

$service = Read-Host "Enter a Windows service name"

if (Get-Service -Name $service -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue) {
    Write-Host "✅ Service '$service' exists."
} else {
    Write-Host "❌ Service '$service' not found."
}

🧠 Reflection
Scripting transforms you from operator to orchestrator.
Today I learned how to build small tools that reduce repetitive work and show I'm thinking like a true sysadmin.
