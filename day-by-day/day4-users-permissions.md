# üßë‚Äçüíª Day 4 ‚Äì Users, Groups, and Permissions in Linux

**Date:** July 10, 2025  
**Focus Area:** User & group management, file permissions, and security principles in Linux.

## üìù What I Learned

### üë• Linux User & Group Management

- `useradd`, `usermod`, and `userdel` are used to manage users.
- `groupadd`, `groupmod`, and `groupdel` are used to manage groups.
- Every user has a **UID** and every group has a **GID**.
- You can assign users to **multiple groups** for permission control.

### üßæ Commands Practiced

```bash
# Create a new user
sudo useradd -m johndoe

# Set a password for the user
sudo passwd johndoe

# Create a new group
sudo groupadd developers

# Add user to a group
sudo usermod -aG developers johndoe

# Show user group membership
groups johndoe
```

üîí File Permissions
Linux Permissions Breakdown:

Each file has owner, group, and others permission categories.

- r = read (4)

- w = write (2)

- x = execute (1)

Example:
diff

```bash

-rwxr-xr--  1 robert developers 1234 Jul 10 14:35 script.sh
```

- Owner: robert ‚Üí read/write/execute

- Group: developers ‚Üí read/execute

- Others: ‚Üí read only

üõ† Permission Commands
```bash

# Change ownership
sudo chown robert:developers script.sh

# Change permissions using symbolic mode
chmod u+x script.sh   # Add execute to user
chmod g-w script.sh   # Remove write from group

# Change permissions using numeric mode
chmod 755 script.sh   # rwxr-xr-x
chmod 644 file.txt    # rw-r--r--
```

ü™ü Windows User & Group Management

Learned how to manage users via:

- Local Users and Groups (lusrmgr.msc)

- Computer Management > Local Users and Groups

Understood NTFS permissions:

- Permissions include: Full Control, Modify, Read & Execute, Read, Write

- Permissions can be set per user or group

- NTFS allows explicit deny, inheritance, and auditing

- File shares are controlled by combining Share permissions and NTFS permissions:

- Most restrictive permission wins.

üß© Example Concepts:

- A user may have Full Control via group membership but Deny applied individually will override it.

- Used icacls command line tool to inspect/set permissions:

```cmd

icacls "C:\TestFolder"
icacls "C:\TestFolder" /grant johndoe:(M)
```

- Understood how Active Directory (AD) is used in enterprises to centralize user/group management.

- Saw how Group Policy Objects (GPOs) apply system-wide security and user access policies.

üîê Key Takeaways

- Both Linux and Windows enforce the principle of least privilege.

- Groups make permissions scalable ‚Äî whether on Ubuntu or Windows Server.

- The tools differ, but the goal is the same: control who can access what, and how.

- File ownership and permission troubleshooting is a critical daily task in sysadmin work.



üîê Key Takeaways

- Principle of least privilege is essential: users should only have access to what they need.

- Using groups simplifies permission management for teams.

- chmod, chown, and chgrp are vital tools in a sysadmin's toolkit.

- Both Linux and Windows enforce the principle of least privilege.

- Groups make permissions scalable ‚Äî whether on Ubuntu or Windows Server.

- The tools differ, but the goal is the same: control who can access what, and how.

- File ownership and permission troubleshooting is a critical daily task in sysadmin work.

üìå What I Practiced Today

- Created new users and groups on my Ubuntu VM

- Assigned users to multiple groups

- Modified file permissions and ownership

- Used ls -l, id, getent, whoami, and sudo to observe system behavior

- Broke down chmod numeric values and practiced converting between symbolic and numeric modes

üß† Reflection

Today was eye-opening. I now see how important it is to understand both Linux and Windows environments, especially since most real-world sysadmin jobs are hybrid. Managing users and file security isn't just routine ‚Äî it's how systems stay protected and efficient.

I‚Äôm more confident now setting up users, securing files, and knowing how to troubleshoot access issues.
