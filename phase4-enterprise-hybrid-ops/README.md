# Phase 4 — Enterprise Hybrid Ops & Automation

This phase adds enterprise/MSP realities on top of the Hybrid SysAdmin foundation:

- PowerShell + Microsoft Graph reporting automation
- Azure SQL awareness for operations workflows
- Power BI dashboard interpretation (ops consumer)
- ITSM practices (ServiceNow-style ticketing + documentation)
- Safe support for internal tools (C#/VBA ecosystems) with secure ops practices

This phase is designed to increase employability in MSP, enterprise, and post-M&A environments.
